# Audio2Art-Tranformation
An end-to-end Generative AI project converts audio prompts into images by using speech recognition and diffusion models, along with libraries from Hugging Face and PyTorch. I built an interactive web interface with Streamlit and implemented text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion models from Stability AI.
